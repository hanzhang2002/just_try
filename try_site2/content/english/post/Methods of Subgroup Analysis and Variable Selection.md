1. Read related academic literatures and presented [two of them](https://github.com/invierno0204/my_document/tree/main/related_literatured).(with the proof of supplementary material verified.)
2. Summarized thoughts related to the general process to:
(1) Attach various penalties to the initial regression model, such as Lasso, Ridge Regression, SCAD and MCP.
(2) Implement the model with the L0 penalty using the iterative algorithm ADMM.
(3) Prove the theoretical properties by using an oracle estimator.
